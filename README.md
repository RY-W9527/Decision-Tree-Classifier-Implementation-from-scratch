# Decision-Tree-Classifier-Implementation-from-scratch
• Implemented a Decision Tree model from scratch, supporting continuous feature splitting and  entropy-based information gain.  • Designed an object-oriented framework with training, prediction, pruning, and visualization modules.  • Improved model robustness by implementing post-pruning.
